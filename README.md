## Hello World web app for SignalK

This github repo is shared in the hope that others might also find value in developing SignalK webapp from first-principles.<br>
In a world of inceasing use of AI to write code (and other things), I think it important that developers can, if they so wish, still build applications 'from the ground up'.<br>

### Engineering Philosophy
My philosophy, as an engineer, is that if I can build one exemplar from first principles, then I am confortable using that, or others' work, as the basis for future exemplars. But, if I have not built one from first principles, there are still elements of a 'black box' about the process, where I must trust that the elements I incorporate (or re-use) from others, do exactly what the documentaiton says they do, and that I am fully capable of modifying that code to my needs. I am not that trusting. I want to undersand what is going on 'under-the'hood' before I can be comfortable reusing others' work.
